i want help to get this project finished

animal observation odyssey is a 2d self contain gacha game that is meant to have every "animal" on earth. 

instead of directly catching and caring for each animal, the player is focused more towards the species. 

a pokedex like tracking system of animals seen and traits learned 

3 ways to cause the gacha loop, each affecting the "world" of the game slightly. 

2 final endingsm leading to a final game of animal gacha, focused on a special theme of animals. 

2 endings, conservation and collapse, dependant on the players actions

a limited amount of animals are "kept and cared for" but any extras must be sold 

the animals kept cost currency

currency is earned through collabs, grants, poaching
(no animals are implied to die or be harmed in this game, we most likely wont touch on diesease) 

i cannot figure out how to code so ill just write my mad scriblings here and hope fro the best.

id like the main scree after the player loads in to be the players home with multiple doors (in a sensible fashion) leading to the animal space, travel for animals, possibly a third door

the animals space will be kept limited for the duration of the game, with effort maybe a max of 15 animals. maybe a size puzzle a la resident evil inventory. 

the travel door takes the player to the 3 H selection, Hang out, Help, Hunt

hang out is a brief expedition into the area of interest. 3 to 8 animals can appear sharing up to 1/3 of the traits for that animal. no money is earned.
each animal has a trait list the player can learn, these traits are species wide and include, lifespan, locations, endangered status and more, its written down somewhere. 

help is a conservation fundraiser effort and leads to minigames. the mini games are small minute and a half max pieces of fun,semi randomized via a draft. help gives 1/2 of the traits for the animals helped, raises money for the player and location. (low amt of money gained) 

hunt is a poaching expidition. you will capture 1-3 animals, learn 1/4 of their traits and need to keep or sell immediatly on return. (low amt of money gained) 

after player fully learns the traits of an animal, it lowers its rate of view, and increases the luck? stat of the player (encouraging rarer animals to be seen and less repeats to occcur, repeat animals also can cause rerolls in hang and help) 

after the action selection, the player moves into a draft screen

this draft features 4 options, the player should select 2 to hold them as options and then redraft the other 2 and then pick one of the locations

the locations are the continents and oceans of earth. (some animals will be in more the one location) 

a brief travel scene (boat train plane bike car bus walking) 
a screen that looks like the location 
a few hidey places for the player to tap
the animal from the location is displayed along with some traits
next animal
return travel scene
updates on animal odyysey quest scroll? ( not a results screen, just updates on overall goals, all traits got, area complete, milestone number of animals seen)

not art style planned or chosen. so far just using free images of animals for now. 
planned on a few images per animal, random pick of which image appears. 

animals deffinatly includes all mammals. prolly not bugs. maybe on fish. yes to reptiles and amphibians. yes to birds. 
domestic animals have their own space in my game. 
we can get as species specific ad we want. 

the end games: 

Conservation Champ! the player saw every animal in the world one time!
unlocks max space for keeping animals, unlocks domestic animals ( low number of species, high number of variation in images) 
Advanced - Talks To The Animals - Learn Every Trait Of every animal ( including domesticated) 


Collapsed!  the player hunts enough of any animal to cause a eco collapse. ( will need balancing) 
unlocks domesticated animals. 
closes the location the collapse happens on permanently

uhhh some more detail to be sure
the player is no longer able to visit the location
